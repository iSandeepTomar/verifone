# AdyenPOSExample

The AdyenPOSExample is an example iOS app that implements the Adyen POS library. It includes boarding and registering devices, starting transactions and retrieving previously made transactions.

## Installation

CocoaPods is currently required to run the example. Make sure your copy of the `AdyenPOSLib` is in the same directory as where you checked out the `AdyenPOSExample` source. You should end up with the following directory hierarchy:

- `AdyenPOSExample/`
- `AdyenPOSLib/`
  - `AdyenToolkit.podspec`
  - `ios/AdyenToolkit.framework`

Then, run `pod install` in the `AdyenPOSExample/` directory and use the `AdyenPOSExample.xcworkspace` file to run the project.
